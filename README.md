## Introduction

Anomaly detection involves identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm. This project applies several machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and assess their effectiveness. The techniques used include statistical methods and machine learning algorithms tailored to different types of data.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes various features relevant to anomaly detection. Features can vary based on the specific application but often include:

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
- Feature 4

## Models

The project explores several anomaly detection techniques, including:

- Statistical Methods (e.g., Z-Score, IQR)
- Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders)
- Ensemble Methods

Each model's performance was evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify anomalies and minimize false positives.



## Results

The results, including model performance metrics and visualizations, are documented in the `results/` directory. This includes plots such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and anomaly detection results.



## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/atharva1554/Anomaly-Detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Anomaly-Detection
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start working with this project, explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. These notebooks cover data exploration, preprocessing, anomaly detection modeling, and evaluation. The `scripts/` directory contains Python scripts for specific tasks like data cleaning and model training.
